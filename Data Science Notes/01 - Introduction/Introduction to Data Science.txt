DATA SCIENCE:
Whatever happens in between a data and a final mathematical model. Data is the starting point, mathematical model is the end point. Whatever we do inbetween these two points to achieve the math model is called Data Science.

LEARNING FROM THE DATA:
Question is - Can we learn about the world around us using the data?
1. Take data as input
2. Analyse the data for patterns
3. Summarize the pattern in a mathematically precise way

MACHINE LEARNING:
All about automating the above mentioned steps

THE CHALLENGE:
Data = Information + Noise
Information is structured, has a pattern and is consistent.
Noise is unstructured, random and is not consistent.
The challenge of Machine Learning is to try and devise different types of models (say linear, lognormal) into the data to try and eliminate the noise and find a pattern in the information.
